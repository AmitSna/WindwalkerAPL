# WindwalkerAPL
### SimC Windwalker APL used by [Peak of Serenity](http://peakofserenity.com/windwalker/)
The purpose of this repo is to help track changes to the current APL and to archive old versions in an easy to read and edit format. Our goal is to replicate the most accurate and realistic gameplay possible through the APL. Everyone is free to contribute to the monk class module in anyway they're comfortable with either through Github, a copy/paste text document with your change and a comment, or in the Discord channel "Wind_craft".
